        <p>Have you ever used a variable or a function before declaring it in JavaScript? Did it work? Or you were slapped with an error in your console. Whichever the case, your compiler tried to initiate a process named hoisting.</p>
        <p>Hoisting is the act of raising or lifting something. Therefore, hoisting in JavaScript refers to the process where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before the code is executed.</p>
        <p>In this article, I would try my absolute best to explain hoisting using simple examples so it becomes easy for you to understand. We will first look at hoisting in functions. Take a look at the code below.</p>
        <pre className="language-js">
            <code className="language-js">
                function sum(a, b){
                    return a + b;
                }

                

                console.log("sum of 1 and 2 is "sum(a, b)); //sum of 1 and 2 is 3
            </code>
        </pre>
        &ltpre className="language-markup">
            &ltcode className="language-markup">
                &ltdiv class="fuck">Hello&lt/div>
            &lt/code>
        &lt/pre>
